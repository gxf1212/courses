\begin{enumerate}

	\item
	Only L-amino acids are found in natural proteins.
	
	Look along the \(\ce{H-C_\alpha}\) bond, seeing \underline{CO-R-N in
		clockwise} indicates L.
	\item
	Nomenclature of main/side chain atoms: \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\dots\)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	N is partially positive (resonance?) while O is partially negative.
	\item
	The 6 atoms are coplanar!
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Look through B-C, if B-A (the nearer) needs to rotate
	\underline{clockwise} to reach superposition with C-D, the angle is
	positive.
	\item
	But in which direction we look through doesn't matter because the
	result is \underline{the same}.
\end{itemize}

		\(\psi : \ce{C_O-C_{\alpha}}\)

The protein structure is almost determined by these angles.

\hypertarget{angle}{%
	\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\(\omega\)
			angle}{\textbackslash{}omega angle}}\label{angle}}

It is usually fixed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	For proline, groups in \emph{trans} is less repulsive, but there's
	\emph{cis}.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics{1_3.png}
		\caption{1\_1}
	\end{figure}
	\item
	For others, \emph{trans} is almost always favored (8 kJ/mol).
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics{1_4.png}
		\caption{1\_1}
	\end{figure}
	\item
	However, some X-Pro structures are \emph{cis}
\end{itemize}

Assumption: No two atoms in a molecule can come any closer than the sum
of their \textbf{van der Waals radii}. Those who disobeys it are called
"disallowed conformations".

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	The plot is similar for most amino acids.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics{1_5.png}
		\caption{1\_5}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		There are semi-allowed regions, where the distances are slightly
		less than the sum of vdw radii. 
		\item
		For a certain kind of protein, we can draw the plot according to
		statistical data. Those who are out of allowed region might be in
		linkers, turns or loops.
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	two special AAs
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		The plot of Gly has a larger area and is centralsymmetric. Both are
		due to the R group is simply a small H atom.
		\item
		\(\phi\) of Pro is fixed to about 60° because of the fixed
		cyclopentane. \(\psi\) is most favored at about -60° and 160°
		\item
		Gly often interrupts \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Pro cannot exist in
		anti-parallel \(\beta\) sheet. Instead, they are often located in
		turns and loops.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\(\chi_1: \ce{N-C_\alpha-C_\beta-C_\gamma}\),
	\(\chi_2: \ce{C_\alpha-C_\beta-C_\gamma-C_\delta}\), then goes along
	the side chain.
	\item
	Possiblities of \(\chi_1\). All are avoiding overlaping with the main
	chain. Because \(\ce{C=O}\) is the bulkiest group,
	\emph{gauche\textsuperscript{+}} (\(\chi_1=-60°\)) is the most
	favored. (trans is 2nd where \(\chi_1=180°\))
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics{1_6.png}
		\caption{}
	\end{figure}
	\item
	\(\chi\) tend to adopt staggered conformations (交错式构象).
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		For aromatic residues, \(\chi_2\) tends to be \(\pm 90°\) to
		minimize close contact with main chain.
		\item
		For residues who form H bond with the environment, the last \(\chi\)
		(Asp, Asn: \(\chi_2\); Glu: \(\chi_3\)) adopts a wide range since
		that bond always rotates.
	\end{itemize}
	
	For those like Tyr who have two ways on the chain, both sides have
	the same \(\chi\) number. This is not so meaningful.
\end{itemize}
