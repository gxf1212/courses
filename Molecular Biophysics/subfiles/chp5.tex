	for an open system (where \(n\) may vary but \(\mu\) doesn't vary
	under constant \(T,P\))
	\[\mathrm{d}G=\sum_i \mu_i\mathrm{d} n_i\]

	\begin{itemize}
		\item

	If only one side (\(\alpha\)) has solute A of molar concentration
	\(C\) that cannot pass through semi-permeable membrane. On the other

	of amtosphere on the liquid).

	\subsubsection{Donnan effect}\label{donnan-effect}}

the ion may start transfering, but have to keep electrical neutrality.

Donnan effect: when one side contains impermeable charged molecule,
concentrations of ions A,B in different side are different.

Write the chemical potential

\[\mu_1=\mu_{\ce{A}}^0+\mu_{\ce{B}}^0+RT\ln C_{\ce{A}}^\alpha+RT\ln C_{\ce{B}}^\alpha\\
\mu_2=\mu_{\ce{A}}^0+\mu_{\ce{B}}^0+RT\ln C_{\ce{A}}^\beta+RT\ln C_{\ce{B}}^\beta\\\]

At equlibrium, \(\mu_1=\mu_2\)

\[C^\alpha_{A}\cdot C^\alpha_{B}=C^\beta_{A}\cdot C^\beta_{B}\]

Note \(z\) is the charge and \(C_M\) is concentration of the
marcomolecule. According to electrical neutrality, let

\[C^\alpha_{A}+zC_M=C^\alpha_{B}=a\\
C^\beta_{A}= C^\beta_{B}=b\\
r=\dfrac{zC_M}{2C^\beta_{A}}\]

then solve it

\[r_D=\dfrac{C^\beta_{A}}{C^\alpha_{A}}=\dfrac{C^\alpha_{B}}{C^\beta_{B}}=r+\left(r^2+1\right)^{0.5}\]

If A is \(\ce{H+}\), then
\(\mathrm{pH}^\alpha-\mathrm{pH}^\beta=\log r_D\)

\hypertarget{combined-effect-membrane-potential}{%
	\subsubsection{combined effect: membrane
		potential}\label{combined-effect-membrane-potential}}

Consider this situation. \(\ce{Na+}\) won't pass through because of the
electric potential. Chemical potential equilibrium can never be reached,
as in the example about osmotic pressure. This system looks like
\underline{the cell} where no ions can freely pass through.

Part two of this section refers to the effect of different
concentration, while part three refers to the effect of charged
molecules.

Define electrochemical potential as their combination

\[\mu^\prime=\mu+Zf\phi\]

where \(Z\) is charge, \(f\) is Faraday constant, \(\phi\) is the
relative electric potential.

At equlibrium, for single ion A on one side:

\[\Delta\varphi=\varphi^{in}-\varphi^{out}=-\dfrac{RT}{Zf}\ln\dfrac{c^{in}}{c^{out}}\]

Ionic concentration difference and membrane potential are generated
simultanously. Maintaining a concentration difference, we get membrane
potential. Still, those which cannot pass through the membrane don't
contribute.

For multiple ions:

\[\Delta\varphi=\varphi^{in}-\varphi^{out}=-\dfrac{RT}{Zf}\ln\dfrac{\sum\limits_{positive} p_ic_{i}^{in}+\sum\limits_{negative} p_jc_{j}^{out}}{\sum\limits_{positive} p_ic_{i}^{out}+\sum\limits_{negative} p_jc_{j}^{in}}\]

where \(p_i\) is permeability. The cell mainly regulates permeability
and sometimes concentration.

\begin{quote}
	summary:
	
	By putting charged marcomolecules and selectively letting ions pass
	through, the cell sets up the difference of concentration of ions as
	well as the electrical potential, acting as the fundation of activities
	like neural signaling.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{in-addition}{%
	\subsubsection{in addition}\label{in-addition}}

inference of osmotic pressure

\[\mu_1^\alpha=\mu_1^0(T,P^\alpha)+RT\ln c_1^\alpha y_1^\alpha\\
\mu_2^\beta=\mu_2^0(T,P^\beta)+RT\ln c_2^\beta y_2^\beta\]

where \(c\) is the molar concentration of water. Here it's approximately
the molar ratio (?)

Due to \(G=U+PV-TS\), \(\mu=V_0P\), \(V_0\) is molar volume of water.

When equilibrium, \(\mu_1^\alpha=\mu_2^\beta\). Assume \(y=1\) So

\[\mu_1^0(T,P^\alpha)-\mu_2^0(T,P^\beta)=V_0(P^\alpha-P^\beta)=-RT\ln\dfrac{c_1^\alpha}{c_2^\beta}\]
